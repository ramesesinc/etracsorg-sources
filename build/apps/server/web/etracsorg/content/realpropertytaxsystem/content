              <!-- Some Text -->
              <p>The Real Property Tax module is the most complex component in the system due to the sheer
                number of transactions and the amount of data it captures. E-TRACS makes sure that errors are
                prevented during transactions and goes to great lengths to achieve it. For example, when subdividing or consolidating lots, several RPUs (Real Property Unit) will be affected, which may require cancellation and re-numbering. E-TRACS will process all these as one transaction so that errors will be avoided. Most
                systems are not very particular with this. In some systems each transaction is done manually. So imagine a lot subdivided into a hundred lots which will magnify chances of errors. If an LGU is not very particular with accuracy of the data stored in their database, then this type of system is acceptable for them. However, in E-TRACS, less than 100% accuracy is not acceptable.</p>

              <p>All assessments in E-TRACS are automatically computed based on the schedule specified. It
                includes assessments for land, building, machinery and plants and trees. Below is a sample screen
