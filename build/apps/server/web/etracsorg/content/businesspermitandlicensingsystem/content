              <p>One of the truly unique features of E-TRACS is the use of rule engines in the BPLS Module. Establishment of business taxes, permit fees and charges when applying for business is very difficult to automate considering the different practices of LGUs in imposing taxes and fees. What is applicable to one LGU may not apply to the other. Most systems resort to reprogramming and customization for those areas not handled in their program design. This is not cost-efficient and most definitely very hard to maintain. What makes it difficult is that tax imposition is not straight forward that one can simply lookup tax tables or use formulas. It is highly unstructured and dependent on information provided by the business applicant. Some proposals were made to standardize fees so that LGUs will adapt to the system, not the other way around.</p>
              <p>However, this approach would be next to impossible considering that LGUs are autonomous and have their jurisdiction to maximize their revenues or lower taxes as they see fit. It is for this reason why TRACS had its limitation. E-TRACS has made a huge improvement in this area by employing rule engines. A rule engine is a special software that executes rules in a runtime environment. Rules are authored by the business expert, and during execution, data or facts are evaluated and the appropriate rules are fired to produce the outcome.</p>

             <p>With the use of the rule engine, E-TRACS was able to accurately capture ordinances in the LGUs.
              In fact, LGUs also realized that they could improve on their way of computation because the system helped them realize that they were under-collecting on some businesses due to improperly categorizing lines of business or segregating essential from non-essential sales, which they missed out before because of the tediousness of such computations.</p>
